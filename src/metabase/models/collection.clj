;; "Location Paths" are strings that keep track of where a Colllection lives in a filesystem-like hierarchy. Almost
;; all of our backend code does not need to know this and can act as if there is no Collection hierarchy; it is,
;; however, presented as such in the UI. Perhaps it is best to think of the hierarchy as a faÃ§ade.
;;
;; For example, Collection 30 might have a `location` like `/10/20/`, which means it's the child of Collection 20, who
;; itself is the child of Collection 10. Note that the `location` does not include the ID of Collection 30 itself.

;; Storing the relationship in this manner, rather than with foreign keys such as `:parent_id`, allows us to
;; efficiently fetch all ancestors or descendants of a Collection without having to make multiple DB calls (e.g. to
;; fetch a grandparent, you'd first have to fetch its parent to get their `parent_id`).
;;
;; The following functions are useful for working with the Collection `location`, breaking it out into component IDs,
;; assembling IDs into a location path, and so forth.
